echo "âœ… COMPLETED STEPS:"
echo "   1. âœ… System dependencies installed"
echo "   2. âœ… Python environment configured"
echo "   3. âœ… Coqui TTS installed"
echo "   4. âœ… Audio files processed and validated"
echo "   5. âœ… Metadata file created (80 entries)"

echo "ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS - START TRAINING:"
echo ""
echo "1. Start model training (2-4 hours):"
echo "   cd /ssd/tts_project"
echo "   source coqui_env/bin/activate"
echo "   python3 scripts/train_model.py"
echo ""
echo "2. Monitor training progress:"
echo "   # In another terminal:"
echo "   tensorboard --logdir /ssd/tts_project/training_output"
echo "   # Then open: http://localhost:6006"

echo "3. Test the trained model:"
echo "   python3 scripts/test_model.py"
echo "   # Or interactive mode:"

echo "ðŸ“ˆ TRAINING TIMELINE:"
echo "   - Setup & preprocessing: 5-10 minutes"
echo "   - Training starts producing speech: ~200 epochs (30-45 min)"
echo "   - Good quality speech: ~400-600 epochs (2-3 hours)"
echo "   - Training auto-saves every 1000 steps"
