echo "ðŸ“Š OPTION 1: FULL MODEL TRAINING"
echo "   Duration: 2-4 hours"
echo "   Quality: Very high (after convergence)"
echo "   Data requirement: Best with 500+ samples"
echo "   Resource usage: High GPU/CPU usage"
echo "   Resumable: Yes (from checkpoints)"
echo "   Command: python3 scripts/train_model.py"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ“Š OPTION 2: VOICE CLONING (RECOMMENDED)"
echo "   Duration: 5-15 minutes"
echo "   Quality: High (immediate results)"
echo "   Data requirement: Works great with 80 samples"
echo "   Resource usage: Moderate"
echo "   Resumable: N/A (too fast to need)"
echo "   Command: python3 scripts/voice_clone.py"

echo "ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR DATASET:"
echo "   With 80 samples (~9 minutes), VOICE CLONING is better because:"
echo "   âœ… Faster results (minutes vs hours)"
echo "   âœ… Better quality with small datasets"
echo "   âœ… Uses state-of-the-art XTTS technology"
echo "   âœ… Perfect for your use case"
echo ""
echo "ðŸš€ SUGGESTED WORKFLOW:"
echo "   1. Try voice cloning first (quick & high quality)"
echo "   2. If you want to experiment, try full training later"
echo "   3. Voice cloning will give you immediate usable results"
